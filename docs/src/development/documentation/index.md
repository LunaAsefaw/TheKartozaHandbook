# Project Documentation

The subdirectories within this folder contain the generic boiler plate files required for project documentation.

Copy the template files and rename them as needed (e.g. `mkdocs-base-template.yml` would be copied and become `mkdocs-base.yml`).

The `repo-template` folder represents the start of a blank repository.

Edit the `nav` section of the `mkdocs-base-template.yml` to have the correct relevant pathways.
